       "407  Sorry to keep bringing back last year, but at the beginning of the playoffs last season you mentioned that your approach would be to continue what you were doing through the regular season. Unlike Japan, where the playoffs don't start right away after the end of the regular season, you face your first start immediately, and what are some of the thoughts going through your mind now as compared to last year? \\r\\n DAISUKE MATSUZAKA (THROUGH INTERPRETER): As you said, the season just ended, and my start is already right around the corner, but during this week I've stayed on the same rhythm and stayed with the same program in terms of preparation and if I think too much that this is the playoffs, that this is going to be different, I think there is a danger there. \\r\\n If we can maintain our own pace as a team, I think we have a better chance of winning.  \n",
